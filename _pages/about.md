Hi!

I am Alessandro, I was born in mid 70's and got a strong imprinting in the 80's. I love new wave, synth pop and if I wasn't bald I'd wear a goth hairstyle.

My first computer was a ZX Spectrum, I learned Basic as my first programming language. 90's were great and nowadays Javascript sucks.

Welcome to by blog.

Sandro 

(my wife calls me Sdurz and the domain name was cheap)
