Well some time ago I stumbled upon [this article](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-gen-x-90s-teen-spirit/) on Wired, so I decided to give TikTok a try.

Ok, that's not the point of this post. The point is TikTok is entirely focused on short videos and this lead naturally to comedy, short and hilarious gags, sometimes sarcastic. Nothing new in my opinion, lot of comedy because the format lends to it. Something valueable, mostly not.

The one thing that TikTok has to offer is ageism, tons of it.
