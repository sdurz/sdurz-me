Well some time ago I stumbled upon [this article](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-gen-x-90s-teen-spirit/) on Wired, so I decided to give TikTok a try.

Of course, as a lurker. I don't like to publish content for the sake of visibility, I still don't get this thing of _metterci la faccia_ as we say in Italy. I first come on the internet
in mid '90s when everything was anonymous and noone cared about your true name, your face or even worse, your car.

Ok, that's not the point of this post. The point is TikTok is entirely focused on short videos and this lead naturally to comedy, short and hilarious gags, sometimes sarcastic. Still TikTok brings a lot of showoff
from the usual 

Nothing new in my opinion, lot of comedy because the format lends to it. Something valueable, mostly not.

The one thing that TikTok has to offer is ageism, tons of it.
