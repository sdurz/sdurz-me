# uBot is on Github!

I've pushed my latest pet project to Github! Find [uBot](https://github.com/sdurz/ubot) on Github. At the moment, the code is very much work in progress and this is just the first of 
a serie of posts about uBot.

I'm writing this library in the process of learning Golang, I'm trying to write a library that aims to be minimalistic and idiomatic and 
allows me to keep it up to date with minimal effort. 


I've chosen not to wrap every single message type and I opted for wrappping JSON values into generic structures that provide some handy accessor methods:
- You will have to read the documentation from Telegram to know how to craft request messages or access response values. BUT you will always find up to date documentation on Telegram's site.
- You will have to learn how to use some JSON accessor methods. BUT you don't have to deal with optional values, pointers or other peculiarities of the API messages.
